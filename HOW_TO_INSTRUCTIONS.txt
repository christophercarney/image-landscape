I've attached several .csv files and also the .jpg images that they were derived from. 
In image.scd on line 10 you can change the .csv file name and then you must redefine the whole block and start the task again.
The task represents the entire soundscape of the image and once starting the synth I recommend looking back at the image to get the full effect.

The program will work with any images but it is meant to work with landscapes and nature pictures. In the project folder there is the \im_analyzer folder
and inside is im_analyzer.py. On line 5 you can give it the path to any image and it will output a .csv file. Move the outputted .csv file into the same directory
as image.scd and repeat the process above. You will also need to download the "pillow" library for python 3 in order for the python script to run correctly.

However, all that above is fairly involved, so that's why I included an array of different image/csv files to use without having to hassle with any python.
